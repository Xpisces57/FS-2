# Experiment 2.3: Responsive Navigation Bar & Client-Side Routing

# Aim
To design a responsive navigation bar using a UI component library and implement client-side routing within a Single Page Application. This experiment demonstrates both a generic routing SPA and a personal profile dashboard.

# Procedure
Import a Navbar component from a UI library (e.g., Bootstrap, Material UI, or a custom one).
Add navigation links to different sections/pages of the SPA.
Ensure responsiveness of the navigation bar across various screen sizes.
Integrate a routing library (like React Router DOM) to manage client-side navigation without full page reloads.
Define routes for different sections (e.g., Home, Features, Contact, Dashboard, Profile, Skills, About).
Implement distinct components for each route.
